- Goal
  - You need to generate {num} independent test samples according to given instructions. These samples will be used as settings of a given game, and to evaluate players' ability.
  - Your output will be parsed into a python list, and each element describes a setting. So strictly follow the format below.
  - For example, you should generate a list like this:
    ```python
    [
        [['setting1': 'str_value1'], ['setting2': int_value2]],
        [['setting1': 'str_value3'], ['setting2': int_value4]]
    ]
    ```

- Instruction
1. The game we are targeting is {algorithm}. The rule is as follows:
{description}

2. Note that all settings you need to generate are inside `[[...]]` in above game description. More formally, they are
{settings}

3. Try to make the data you generate have a difficulty gradient.
