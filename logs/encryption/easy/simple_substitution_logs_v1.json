You need to understand the detailed working principle of this black-box by interacting with it in multiple turns. \n\n2. Goal:\n- You have 1 final goal: You need to understand how the encryption method operates by interacting with the black-box within given interaction turns. \n\n3. Black-box property:\n- The black-box will remind you the remaining number of turns in each turn.\n- The black-box takes plaintext as input and ciphertext as output.\n- The plaintext only allows uppercase or lowercase English letters (A-Z, a-z) and blank space.\n\n4. Interaction rules:\n- To finish the goal, you need to interact with the black-box. The interaction rules are as follows:\n  - Interaction Rule 1: First you need to assign plaintext as input to black-box. You can only assign one plaintext in each turn. You can assign any plaintext freely, but you must make sure the plaintext **only** contains uppercase or lowercase English letters (A-Z, a-z) and blank space.\n  - Interaction Rule 2: You will receive the black-box output, which is ciphertext, after you assign specific plaintext.\n\n5. Output format:\n- You must strictly obey the output format rules: When you want to assign value for plaintext, **only output the plaintext**. DO NOT output any unrelated text or symbols like \"Let's input\", \"I'll try\", \"\\n\".\n- If you understand the working principle of black-box before reaching given interaction turns, keep interacting with the black-box to make sure you don't miss any details. DO NOT output text like \"I understand the pattern\".\n\n6. Evaluation:\n- When the given number of interactions is reached, we will present several plaintext and you need to output corresponding ciphertext. **You MUST ONLY output the value, DO NOT contain any other text.**"
