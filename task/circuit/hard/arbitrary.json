Let f(x_1) = 1, f(x_2) = 1, ... f(x_k) = 1. f(x) = (x = x_1) or (x = x_2) or ... or (x = x_k), (x = y) can be construct by ((x[1] and y[1]) or not(x[1] and y[1])) and ((x[2] and y[2]) or not(x[2] and y[2])) and ... We choose $x_1, x_2, ..., x_8$ without any particular pattern and construct the circuit according to that.",
