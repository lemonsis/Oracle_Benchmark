    "description": "Battleship is a strategic guessing game where the player attempts to figure out the location of 3 hidden ships on a 7x7 grid. 3 ships are 1×3, 1×4 and 1×5 respectively, and we use `AAA`, `BBBB` and `CCCCC` to represent them. The player will make guesses by specifying coordinates on the grid, in the form of `(x, y)`, from `(1, 1)` to `(7, 7)`, and the game will provide feedback on whether the guess `hits` or `misses` any ships. Besides the ships, there are two 1x1 bombs denoted as `O`. When the coordinate is bomb, the game will also provide `hits`. Note that the player can only know whether a ship or a bomb is attacked, but not which ship or bomb it is. After a series of guesses, the player need to distinguish the bombs and provide the coordinates of the ships by drawing a grid with `A`, `B` and `C` representing the ships, and `.` representing empty water cells. The grid must be 7x7 in size, and the ships must be placed either horizontally or vertically. For example: `..AAA...\n........\n........\n.......C\n.BBBB..C\n.......C\n.......C\n.......C` is a valid answer. The player must ensure that the ships do not overlap and that they fit within the grid boundaries. The player will win if they correctly identify the locations of all three ships within the allowed number of turns.",
    "answer_format": "A 7x7 char matrix consisting of `A`, `B`, `C` and `.`. Note that there must be three `A`s, or four `B`s, or five `C`s in a row or a column. And they don't overlap."
