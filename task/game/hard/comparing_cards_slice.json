    "description": "Comparing Cards is a game where two players play a card at the same time and compare the number. Initially, both players have [[total_cards]] cards, numbered from 1 to [[total_cards]]. In each turn, both players choose a card on his hand to play at the same time, in the form of `card x`, where `x` is the number on the card between 1 and [[total_cards]], and this card must be available. The player with the higher number wins the turn and earns 1 point, while the other player earns -1 point. If both players play the same number, then both players earn 0 points. The game lasts for [[total_cards]] turns, both players try to maximize their scores.",
    "strategy": "All the cards are arranged in ascending order and divided equally into four piles, named a, b, c, and d, from smallest to largest. The cards are played in the following sequence: Randomly select and play cards from pile b, one at a time, until pile b is empty. Randomly select and play cards from pile d, one at a time, until pile d is empty. Randomly select and play cards from pile a, one at a time, until pile a is empty. Randomly select and play cards from pile c, one at a time, until pile c is empty.",
