    "description": "Comparing Cards is a game where two players play a card at the same time and compare the number. Initially, both players have [[total_cards]] cards, numbered from 1 to [[total_cards]]. In each turn, both players choose a card on his hand to play at the same time, in the form of `card x`, where `x` is the number on the card between 1 and [[total_cards]], and this card must be available. The player with the higher number wins the turn and earns 1 point, while the other player earns -1 point. If both players play the same number, then both players earn 0 points. The game lasts for [[total_cards]] turns, both players try to maximize their scores.",
    "strategy": "First choose the highest card, i.e. `card [[total_cards]]`. Then play cards in ascending order, i.e. play the `card 1` first, then `card 2`, ..., until `card [[total_cards-1]]`.",
