    "description": "Two balls, A and B, are on an infinitely long, smooth plane. Ball A has a mass of 4 kg, and Ball B has a mass of 2 kg. Ball A starts from the origin and moves uniformly along the x-axis at a speed of 3 m/s. Ball B is placed at 12 m from the origin and come to Ball A at a speed of 5 m/s. When the two balls collide, they bounce off each other completely elastically."
