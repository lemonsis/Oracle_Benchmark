    "description": "A simple harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position. The system contains one object. The mass of the object is 1 kg. The spring constant is 100 N/m. The initial displacement from the equilibrium position is 0.2 m (spring in contracted state). The system is vertical and the gravity is 10 m/s^2. The system is released from rest and do not consider any air resistance. The coordinate origin is set at the initial position of the oscillator."
