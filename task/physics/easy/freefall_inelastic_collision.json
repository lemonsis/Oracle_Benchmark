    "algorithm": "free fall to the ground, inelastic collision",
    "description": "A free fall system is a scenario where an object falls under the influence of gravity until it collides with the ground, and then bounces. The system contains one object. The mass of the object is 5 kg. The initial height from which the object is dropped is 20 m. The ground is modeled as a surface that deform inelastically upon impact. The coefficient of restitution is 0.6. The simulation does not consider air resistance. The coordinate origin is set at the ground level. Gravity g is 10 m/sÂ²."
