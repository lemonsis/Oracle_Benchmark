    "description": "There is a table with 999 rows and 6 columns. Each letter in plaintext is sequentially filled into the table row by row. Blank spaces are ignored. Uppercase and lowercase are kept. When all the plaintext letters are filled into the table, the ciphertext is generated by reading letters in the table in a zigzag manner, beginning from the last letter in the last available column (e.g. begin from 't' in the 2-th column for 'at' and begin from 'i' in the 6-th column for 'beautiful'). When reaching the top row, move back down, and when reaching the bottom row, move back up, repeating this pattern until all the letters are read. Letters in the same column are written together and letters in different columns are separated by blank space. For example, if the plaintext is 'Hello World', the ciphertext is supposed to be 'W o dl ll re Ho'.",
    "feature": "case-sensitive, blank-ignored"
