    "description": "Fibonacci cipher is a method of encryption that uses the Fibonacci sequence to determine the shift of each letter in the plaintext. Suppose each letter is represented by a=0, b=1, ..., z=25, A=26, B=27, ..., Z=51. The value of each encrypted letter is its value in plaintext plus a shift number from the Fibonacci sequence and then modulo 52. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The first few numbers in the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... For example, if the plaintext is `HELLO', the first letter `H' is shifted by 1 (the first Fibonacci number), resulting in `I'. The second letter `E' is shifted by 1 (the second Fibonacci number), resulting in `F'. The third letter `L' is shifted by 2 (the third Fibonacci number), resulting in `N'. The fourth letter `L' is shifted by 3 (the fourth Fibonacci number), resulting in `O'. The fifth letter `O' is shifted by 5 (the fifth Fibonacci number), resulting in `T'. Therefore, the ciphertext is `IFNOT'. Keep the blank space in the ciphertext.",
